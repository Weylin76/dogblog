        <h2><strong>Duncan: </strong></h2>
        <img src="images/duncan11.jpg" alt="pic of Duncan">
        <h2>His Nicknames</h2>
        <p>Duncy-Dunc, Monkey, Skunky, or for short Monk, Skunk, or Duncer-Monker. He's been lovingly called
            Dunkin Donuts and Duncan Hines.</p>
        <p>We got Duncan from our friends, the Barkers, in January 2008 when he was 8 weeks old. He was soooo
            tiny- around 2 pounds and melted our hearts instantly! As a puppy, he had the cutest toasted
            marshmallow coloring on his ears and a brown spot on his back where his tail is attached. We called
            it his ‚Äúpoop stain‚Äù. He also had a heart shaped black nose. We've always loved his black eyeliner
            that made his eyes so cute!</p>
        <p>How did we pick his name? When Mike held him, Duncan would move around like he was ‚Äúdunkin and
            divin‚Äù, hence the name Duncan fit our puppy perfectly!</p>
        <p>He always had that independent and sometimes grouchy chihuahua disposition. When he wanted pets, he
            wanted them NOW!! If he didn't want pets, he'd let you know.</p>
        <p>Duncan is super smart- always has been intelligent. He is the only dog we've had that could figure
            out how to open doors and doggy gates by busting in or using his paws. He played fetch tirelessly
            with dad every day! He would also make sure to get loves and would push himself between Mike and me so he
            could get the
            the attention and affection.</p>
        <p>He would also use this method as trickery when his brothers came along. He'd push his way into us
            for affection and pets, so his brothers would drop the bone, treat or toy to come over for attention
            too, and then Duncan would swoop in to take the bone, treat, or toy over for himself. It worked like
            a charm!</p>
        <p>His favorite toy is called ‚Äúthe bug‚Äù that he had since being a puppy. Grandma gave this toy to him,
            and he loves it so much. ‚ÄúBug‚Äù has had a lot of surgeries over the years and although it no longer
            has much fur left, it is still Duncy's favorite.</p>
        <p>We knew Duncan was such a cool pup and deserved a brother to play with and keep him company. Plus he
            made us fall in love with chihuahuas and opened our hearts to adding more little doggies to our
            family!</p>

        <strong>Bear: </strong>
        <div><img src="images/bear15.jpg" alt="pic of bear"></div>
        <h2>Bear's Nicknames </h2>
        <p>Bearcub, Bear-Bear, Bear-Square, Dingo, and Care Bear.</p>
        <p>We took Duncan to pick out his brother in February 2008. We found a nice family in Yuba County that had
            puppies for sale. We loved Bear's brindle color. He was so chubby as a puppy, he had a double chin! He was
            also a bit smaller than Duncan, and Duncan, at about 4 pounds, immediately was obsessed with Bear (around 3
            pounds) and started playing and kicking Bears roly-poly puppy bootie.</p>
        <p>Bear was a bit scared and whiny, but we knew he could stand up to Duncan as needed. So home we went with
            puppy #2!</p>

        <p>How did we pick Bear's name? He was such a little chub that he reminded us of a squishy teddy bear, hence
            his name Bear. As he grew into a teenager pup, he grew out of his chub into our sleek athletic dog. Bear was
            the braun while Duncan was the brains of our dog family. Both pups had so much energy that we'd run with
            them every day, up to 10 miles in a day!</p>
        <p> Bear was the best cuddle buddy ever and contorted his body to mom's back in bed and kept her warm, and was
            always there to let dad pet him to help soothe him in the middle of the night if dad woke up.</p>

        <p>We took Duncan and Bear to puppy training. While Duncan was well behaved and immediately learned to sit and
            lay down, Bear decided he was a mamas boy and would whine and cry and only let mom attempt to train him in
            class, but mostly wanted to be held. Most classes he didn't listen and made messes on the floor. We were
            able to train him to sit at home but he didn't want to do the commands in from of others. During our last
            training class, the graduation, the other puppies in the class were distracted and not cooperating. When it
            was Bear's turn, the trainer asked to show a special trick Bear had learned, and he nailed the doggy high
            five‚Ä¶.twice‚Ä¶and on command!! His high five became his signature trick, and even developed into ‚Äúgive me
            ten‚Äù. It was ‚Äúpawfect‚Äù. üòä</p>

        <p>Duncan and Bear were the best howlers when dad would chant ‚Äúdoggy, doggy, doggy!!‚Äù They taught many friends'
            dogs how to howl too.</p>

        <p>Duncan and Bear went on several hikes with us, and trips to the ocean and mountains. One highly memorable
            trip was to Portuguese Beach in Bodega Bay, and both decided to ‚Äúmountain-billy goat‚Äù climb to the top of
            the steep bluff from the beach. Luckily they listened to us and we called to them and they scurried down and
            was immediately placed back on their leash. They loved chasing each other in the sand! Bear also discovered
            the cattle grazing at Dillon's Beach and jumped out of the truck and started to herd the cows. He also would
            flush the pheasants out of the bushes during our trail walks. He was definitely a chihuahua mix, but mixed
            with what? Our friend said a dingo!</p>

        <p>Bear was such a sweet and special boy and Duncan and Bear would play hard and fight like brothers do. One of
            the funniest moments that friends and family still talk about was Bear's <em>‚Äúextra affection‚Äù</em>
            for blankets, especially dad's Green Bay Packers blanket. Bear somehow always ‚Äúput on a blanket
            show‚Äù when dad had people over to watch the Packers games which resulted in gut-busting laughter!</p>

        <p>We lost Bear in May 2022 unexpectedly. We are so grateful for the 14+ years we had with him!! He was an
            amazing addition to our family and had a great life!!</p>

        <strong>Brewster: </strong>
        <div><img src="images/brew5.jpg" alt="pic of Brewster"></div>
        <h2> His Nicknames</h2>
        <p>Brew-brew, Brew-crew, Little Bit, Lil' Guy, Wiggle-butt, Brucifer, Garfield, and Diva.</p>
        <p>Brewster's ‚Äúgotcha day‚Äù was in March 2020, at the start and height of COVID. He was a rescue, found by our
            friends as a tiny puppy wandering on a busy street. He was estimated to be around 8 weeks old, and our
            friends knew exactly who to introduce this little bundle of male chihuahua-mix joy to. Mike framed it as
            ‚Äúwe're just going to meet this puppy‚Äù but one look at his cute corkscrew tail, followed by his nuzzling and
            falling asleep in our arms, we adopted him on the spot and were glad to have this shining ray of puppy love
            and fun energy during an unprecedented pandemic time of uncertainty and quarantine.</p>
        <p>We loved his tan coloring, and as coffee lovers, we tried out names such as Latte, Frappy, Cold Brew‚Ä¶and then
            his name Brewster came to be.</p>
        <p>He's the only dog we've known that hates going for walks. He'd much rather be a couch potato all day wrapped
            in warm fuzzy blankets. However he absolutely loves car rides, especially when dad takes him to Home Depot
            and Lowe's. Brewster walks proudly with dad into these stores and insists that people give him lots of
            attention and will demand being pet! How would anyone deny attention to such a cute pup that gets so excited
            meeting people that he wiggles his entire back end (which actually earned him his nickname of ‚Äúwiggle
            butt‚Äù!)</p>
        <p>Brewster has no interest in meeting other dogs, though. He truly thinks he's human.</p>
        <p>He loves to eat cheese- good cheese like Tilamook sharp cheddar to be exact, and will hold out on eating hand
            outs of chicken or turkey in case there may be some medium-well steak we're instead handing out soon. His
            adoration of good food and lack of interest in exercise earned him his nickname of Garfield, who resembles
            Brewster in cat form.</p>
        <p>He is also an alarm clock. Each night, at 10 'clock sharp, he jumps off the couch and looks at mom and dad as
            if to say ‚Äúit's time for bed!‚Äù (which is translation for ‚Äúit's time for Brewster's treat!‚Äù) Brewster proudly
            does tricks for treats, such as spin, shake, meerkat, and stand tall! He also won't let us forget his
            bedtime treat and will stand at the corner of the bed and let out one high pitched bark at a time, with 5
            second pauses in between, until he gets his bedtime treat!</p>
        <p>He loves chewing on bull sticks and other chew toys and gnaws on the treats while on top of dad's legs in
            bed, which lulls daddy to sleep.</p>
        <p>One time while getting his nails trimmed by mom- which is not his favorite activity- daddy held him on his
            back and fed him treats to distract him from the pedicure. Brewster thought this was the best ever as dad
            chuckled and said ‚Äúlet me feed you more grapes, your highness‚Äù. It was the easiest nail clipping session
            that day!</p>
        <p>Brewster was our first dog we rescued, but let's be serious - <em> rescued who?!?!!!</em></p>
